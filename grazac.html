     <h6>learning coding for the future</h6>
     Coding has exploded in recent years, changing from something used in computer games and the occasional electronic device, to something which shapes the way that we live in the modern world. This means that now is an excellent time for learning how to code for beginners.

     Pretty much every device, electronic item, and modern piece of machinery contains at least a little bit of code. As the number of use cases for coding grows, the number of coding jobs available will also continue to grow. 
     
     We will begin by defining what coding is and why you should learn it. After this, we will move into a step by step guide to coding for dummies. We will look at some of the most popular coding languages, along with a few online coding courses that will help you learn these languages. A great example of what I'm talking about would be the Udemy Python programming course.
